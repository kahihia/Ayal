<span>Why Bangalore is the Ideal City for Apartment Buyers?</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-1" class="collapse-content">
<p>Bangalore has emerged as a popular destination for real estate investment in recent years. The city is synonymous with a thriving startup ecosystem, multinational corporations, and a strong information technology hub. Moreover, Bangalore is a melting pot of diverse cultures, offering a rich history, vibrant lifestyle, and picturesque greenery. With a steady appreciation of real estate prices, competitive pricing, robust infrastructure, and ample leisure options, Bangalore has become the ideal city for apartment buyers. In this article, we will explore in detail why Bangalore is the perfect place to invest in an apartment.</p>
<h2>Thriving Job Opportunities and IT Hubs in Bangalore</h2>
<p>Bangalore is a leading IT hub that has attracted some of the best IT professionals from around the world. With the presence of companies like Google, Microsoft, Wipro, and Infosys there is never a dearth of IT jobs in the city.</p>
<p>Apart from IT companies, Bangalore is also home to a range of multinational corporations. Top companies such as Amazon, IBM, and Accenture have their offices here. That’s not all! The city boasts of a thriving start-up ecosystem, which is fuelling innovation and job creation.</p>
<p>Bangalore provides a creative and supportive environment for entrepreneurs to turn their innovative ideas into successful businesses. It also provides exceptional networking opportunities for startups, which could be a great starting point for new businesses. This is one of the main reasons why there are more people looking to buy apartments for sale in Bangalore.</p>
<h2>Rapid Infrastructure Development of Bangalore City</h2>
<p>Being one of the fastest-growing cities in India, Bangalore has witnessed a rapid transformation in its infrastructure development over the past few years. The city’s robust IT industry and global presence have significantly accelerated its growth trajectory.</p>
<p>Efforts to build 270 km of roads and around 127 km of metro are all at various stages of development in the city. The metro rail project has brought a significant change to the public transportation infrastructure in Bangalore, which has greatly reduced the traffic congestion in the city. The Bangalore Metro Rail Phase 2A between Silk Board Junction and KR Puram is under construction. This is expected to reduce travel time from Bellandur to KR Puram by 50 minutes.</p>
<p>The Metro Phase 2B project is a 17-station ‘airport-link’ segment of the Blue Line that is currently under construction. It runs from KR Puram to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) in Devanahalli. Starting from Kempegowda International Airport, the route includes Devanahalli, Yelahanka, Hebbal, KR Puram, and further connects to Marathahalli, Bellandur, and Silk Board.</p>
<p>The construction of flyovers, underpasses, and widening of roads has dramatically transformed the city’s traffic management, making it more efficient. The upcoming Satellite Town Ring Road (STRR) is expected to benefit the industrial and logistics industries since it will simplify the distribution and delivery of goods to Karnataka’s interior. This six-lane corridor will pass through three districts in Karnataka (Bengaluru Rural, Bengaluru Urban, and Ramanagara), as well as one district in Tamil Nadu (Krishnagiri).</p>
<p>Another important development is the Peripheral Ring Road (PRR), whose growth would significantly affect the Yelahanka-Kogilu-Jakkur regions . This 8-lane, 74 km PRR will connect Tumakuru and Hosur roads through Hessaraghatta Road, Doddaballapur Road, Ballari Road, Hennur Road, Old Madras Road, Hoskote Road and Sarjapur Road.</p>
<p>Additionally, initiatives such as smart city projects and improvements to water supply systems have vastly improved living standards in many neighbourhoods. All these efforts towards infrastructural transformation have helped position Bangalore as an attractive destination for businesses and entrepreneurs looking to expand their enterprise in India.</p>
<h2>Educational Institutions and Student Population</h2>
<p>Bangalore has earned a well-deserved reputation as an educational hub with its world-renowned universities and institutions. The city boasts some of India’s best engineering colleges, the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Institute of Science</a> (IISc), the <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Institute of Technology</a> (IIT) and the <a href="https://www.nitk.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Institute of Technology</a> (NIT). The city is also home to prestigious management institutes such as the <a href="https://www.iimb.ac.in/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Institute of Management Bangalore</a> (IIMB). Additionally, there are several other specialized institutes in areas such as design and hospitality that attract students from across the country. Not only does Bangalore have exceptional academic programs for higher education, but it also has numerous quality schools for primary and secondary education, making it an ideal place to grow up for those focused on pursuing their academic interests.</p>
<p>With a rising population and robust economic growth, more people are moving to Bangalore for better educational facilities and employment opportunities. This influx of people has created a high demand for apartments, driving up real estate prices considerably.</p>
<h2>Pleasant Climate and Cosmopolitan Lifestyle in Bangalore</h2>
<p>Popularly called the ‘<a href="https://www.holidify.com/pages/garden-city-of-india-1863.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Garden City</a>’, Bangalore is renowned for its pleasant climate. In fact, the city is located at a height of over 3,000 feet (914.m) above sea level, which is above Dehradun (630 m). This allows Bangalore to receive more rainfall and experience cooler temperatures, all year round.</p>
<p>With the presence of many global IT companies, the city has become a hub for skilled professionals from different parts of the world. Consequently, it has a cosmopolitan lifestyle with a diverse population of people from different ethnicities and cultures living together in harmony. This has led to the city becoming a melting pot of food, art, music, and culture, making it a fascinating place to live and explore. The blend of favourable weather, diverse culture, and exciting opportunities in Bangalore makes it an ideal place to live, study, and work.</p>
<p>Bangalore boasts of numerous apartments with large, open spaces and surrounded by lush greenery, making the perfect investment option for homebuyers.</p>
<h2>Growing Demand for Residential Properties in Bangalore</h2>
<p>The Silicon Valley of India has witnessed a surge in demand for residential properties, especially apartments in recent years. Bangalore’s growth as a hub for various industries, including IT/ITES, biotechnology, and aviation, has attracted professionals and entrepreneurs from different parts of the country and even abroad. Many IT companies have established their offices in the city, creating considerable demand for apartments. The city’s proximity to tech parks and the easy availability of other amenities such as schools, hospitals, and shopping centres is another incentive for many people to invest in residential properties, particularly apartments in Bangalore.</p>
<p>The locational advantage of Bangalore also plays a vital role in the rise in demand for apartments in the city. Bangalore is well-connected to other parts of the country via rail, road, and air. The presence of the International airport and the upcoming metro rail projects has significantly enhanced the connectivity of the city. This has made Bangalore an attractive destination for people looking to relocate in search of better job opportunities or a better standard of living.</p>
<p>Additionally, the city’s cosmopolitan culture, pleasant weather, and excellent education and healthcare facilities make it an ideal place to settle down. These factors have contributed to the rise in demand for apartments in Bangalore. The city’s real estate market has been experiencing a sustainable demand for affordable and premium apartments, making it a lucrative investment option for many homebuyers and investors. With the ongoing expansion of the city’s infrastructure and an ever-increasing demand for apartments, Bangalore’s real estate sector is expected to witness further growth in the coming years.<br/>
Bangalore’s population has been on the rise in the recent past. According to recent estimates, the city’s population stands at over 13 million people , and it’s expected to rise even further in the coming years. This consistent surge has led to a significant increase in demand for apartments and infrastructure development, leading to an appreciation of property value.</p>
<h2>Availability of Luxury Apartments for Sale and Gated Communities in Bangalore</h2>
<p>Given that Bangalore is known for its modern infrastructure and cosmopolitan lifestyle, it is no surprise that luxury apartments and gated communities are among the most sought-after residential options in the city. These exclusive properties come equipped with top-of-the-line amenities such as sports facilities, clubhouses, swimming pools, spas, and more.</p>
<p>The architecture of these properties showcases the latest design trends and caters to residents who seek a luxurious living experience. Gated communities offer a sense of safety and security, where residents feel comfortable letting their children play outdoors or go on walks alone. Additionally, they often boast of green areas like parks or landscaped gardens that provide a peaceful respite from the busy urban environment.</p>
<p>For those looking for top-notch accommodations in Bangalore, luxury apartments for sale and gated communities are definitely worth exploring.</p>
<p>One of SOBHA’s renowned projects, inspired by Spanish architecture is SOBHA Galera. These 4-bedroom duplex and triplex row houses are created to provide you with extraordinary luxury and unrivalled convenience.</p>

<h2>Investment Potential and ROI of Bangalore Flat Properties</h2>
<p>Bangalore’s real estate market is developing, and there is a growing demand for both commercial and residential buildings, primarily apartments. The city provides better living conditions as well as greater career chances. Bangalore has made massive progress in terms of technology, transit, connection, upscale facilities, etc.</p>
<p>The professionals who relocate from various regions of Karnataka and India in a quest for better employment and a higher quality of life are the major source of the increasing demand for apartments for sale. Bangalore offers its residents a high quality of life by providing the greatest possible healthcare, education, and leisure opportunities.</p>
<p>The residential market in Bangalore offers both monthly rewards and capital growth. The rise in the number of young people moving to Bangalore for work or school tends to be the main driver of the city’s rental demand. The investor is guaranteed renters and a substantial monthly income in the form of rent by investing in quality apartments.</p>
<p>According to reports , there has been a dramatic increase in property values and rental yields in seven major cities over the past five years. Average property prices in Bengaluru and Hyderabad have increased by 10% during the last five years. According to data, the average price of a square foot of real estate in Bengaluru was Rs 4,894 in 2018 and rose to Rs 5,570 in 2022.</p>
<p>Supportive Policies and Regulations for Flat Buying/ Selling in Bangalore, Karnataka<br/>
The real estate industry was somewhat impacted by the pandemic epidemic. As workers moved back to their hometowns and prospective purchasers held off on purchases, the real estate market in all the major cities weakened. Construction on ongoing projects was also halted because of the lockdown.</p>
<p>The Karnataka government then revived the real estate industry. It was then decided that the stamp duty rate on houses costing between INR 35 and INR 45 lakhs will be reduced from 5% to 3%.</p>
<p>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has launched an e-Khata or e-Aasthi developed by the state’s e-governance department and NIC (National Informatics Centre). This would assist property buyers in uploading all property papers and their Aadhaar numbers online to apply for Khatas. Within a month, the digitally signed Khata certificates will be produced and distributed to property buyers.</p>
<p><strong>How Can You Apply for an e-Khata?</strong></p>
<p>An e-Khata application can be submitted in any of the following ways:</p>
<p>&#8211;  You can manually apply for an e-Khata by going to a nearby Bangalore One centre.<br/>
Or by visiting the SAKALA website and entering your PID number, you can also submit an online application for e-Khata.</p>
<p>&#8211; Fill out the e-Khata application form online and include any supporting documents, such as a sale deed, an encumbrance certificate, an ID card, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211;  The application will receive a SAKALA acknowledgement number after it has been processed. After which you’ll receive a digital signature. Finally, you may download the e-Khata.</p>
<p>In the event your application gets rejected, an officer will contact you and have you submit the documents once again.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Bangalore appears to be simply waiting for you if you’re in the pursuit of settling down in one of the most vibrant cities that boasts of a pleasant climate all year round. You may also discover a world of individual villas or beautifully themed apartments with numerous amenities and high-end facilities, amidst verdant surroundings.</p>
<p>Real estate developers have been encouraged by the multiracial population to invest in developments with characteristics designed to meet the ever-growing needs of homebuyers.

<span>Luxury Living in Bangalore: A Handy Guide to High-end Residential Projects in the City</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-5" class="collapse-content">
<p>For many an aspirant, Bangalore is a dream destination. For decades, the city has been receiving people from all over the country, thanks to its eternal charm. Over the years, the city’s reputation as a pensioners’ paradise has made way for ‘India’s IT capital.’ Still, that one moniker the city is most famous for, the ‘garden city’, remains intact, so is its salubrious climate. As Bangalore is growing at an exponential rate, there emerges a new affluent class who prefer to live their life in the lap of luxury.</p>
<h2>Luxury Living – an Ever-evolving Concept</h2>
<p>Luxury is constantly evolving. All the more so when it comes to luxury homes. However, there are certain parameters that would make a home a luxury home. First among these are the amenities – the more, the better. Ideally, a luxury home should have clubhouses, swimming pools, open areas, children’s play area, multiple avenues for leisure, etc. In addition to amenities, leveraging technology for comfort and convenience is another attribute of a luxury residence. For example, smart homes / automated homes are a preferred choice for those who seek luxury living. Finally, in a city like Bangalore where traffic is a concern for many, a home that is well-connected and is close to office spaces, schools, hospitals, and other conveniences is indeed a luxury.</p>
<h2>Growing demand for luxury residential projects in Bangalore</h2>
<p>Ever since the IT boom started, Bangalore has acquired a special place in the global information technology horizon. Soon, organisations of international repute started setting up their offices in sprawling IT parks in Bangalore, providing lucrative jobs to hundreds of thousands of people. These well-paying jobs have been creating a new breed of men and women with disposable incomes and immense purchase power. As a result, over the years, Bangalore has been witnessing a steady demand for luxury residential projects.</p>
<p>Yet another factor that propels the growth of high-end residential projects in Bangalore is the constant demand from NRIs. Among the cities in India, Bangalore sees the most demand for luxury homes from NRIs, followed by Pune, reports property consultant, <a href="https://anarock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ANAROCK</a>. Both <a href="https://rera.karnataka.gov.in/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RERA</a> and GST have a significant role to play in this change. While the former has made buying a home easier and more transparent, GST offers immense financial benefits to customers. Earlier, homebuyers had to pay a bouquet of charges such as service tax, value-added tax, etc. Currently, all these have been subsumed under GST. What’s more, for under-construction homes that don’t come under ‘affordable housing’, GST rate is 5%. Before the implementation of GST, it was 12%.</p>
<h2>Factors Influencing Luxury Living in Bangalore</h2>
<p>While we have touched upon a few factors that contribute to a home’s luxury quotient, let’s delve deeper now and analyse each attribute of a luxury home in Bangalore.</p>
<p><strong>Location and Proximity to Key Amenities  </strong></p>
<p>In a city like Bangalore, where millions of commuters hit the road on every single day, commuting can be a dampener. Hence, choosing a location close to workplaces, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and other conveniences would ensure that you don’t spend quality time in traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Architectural Design and Innovative Features</strong></p>
<p>As we have already mentioned, the concept of luxury homes is constantly evolving. Homes with innovative architecture and themes are high in demand. SOBHA – one of the pioneers in themed architecture – creates homes inspired by architectural styles, eras, and other distinguished characteristics. Thus, SOBHA’s residential portfolio includes homes crafted in the architectural footsteps of Bangalore Palace, New York, the Spanish town of Galera, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Construction and Materials Used</strong></p>
<p>A customer pays more for a luxury home. Obviously, they have every right to know about the quality of construction and materials used and ensure that they are of the highest quality. SOBHA – a name synonymous with quality construction uses precast technology – a unique way of constructing homes in a controlled environment, ensuring impeccable quality, matchless precision, and ahead-of-time delivery. The meticulously crafted structure of your home has been built to protect your home from earthquakes, can withstand fire and guard against corrosion.</p>
<p><strong>Security and Privacy Considerations</strong></p>
<p>A home is where you feel the most secured. Privacy is a key characteristic of a luxury home. Modern luxury homes by SOBHA feature sure-fire methods to make sure that your home meets superior security standards. From round-the-clock CCTV surveillance to cutting-edge facilities that prevent any violations, security is of prime importance. When it comes to privacy, SOBHA goes the extra mile to deliver homes that do not have common walls, balconies facing each other, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Availability of High-end Facilities and Services</strong></p>
<p>A luxury home will feature an array of high-end facilities, services as well as amenities. The purpose of these is to make the residents’ lives easier, provide them with options to unwind and contribute to the overall quality of life. A high-end luxury home will have dedicated facilities for leisure – a clubhouse, for instance, sports facilities, multiple swimming pools for both adults and children, pet parks, convenient stores, open spaces, concierge services and more. When you choose to live in a luxury home by SOBHA, you can expect all these and more.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability and Eco-friendly Features</strong></p>
<p>The world over, there is an increasing awareness about sustainable practices. Conscious individuals choose to live in homes that are made sustainably and where eco-friendly methods are followed every day to preserve water, save energy and more. The advanced precast construction methodologies designed and developed by SOBHA keep sustainability at the core. The advantages include reduced consumption of energy, water, and building materials. In addition to these, SOBHA’s luxury residential projects in Bangalore have won many an award and accolade for the ways in which they preserve natural resources by recycling water and harnessing the power of the sun.</p>
<h2>Overview of High-end Residential Projects in Bangalore</h2>
<p>With close to three decades of developing high-end residential projects in Bangalore as well as other cities across India, SOBHA has raised the bar in the segment. Besides SOBHA, other A-Grade developers have also been developing luxury residential projects in Bangalore for years.</p>
<p>Currently, for those who seek to buy a luxury residence in Bangalore, options are aplenty in the forms of apartments, penthouses, villas, and row houses.</p>
<p>When it comes to luxury residential apartments, some of the most prominent locations are Koramangala, Indiranagar, HSR Layout, Bellandur, Hennur, Banashankari, Sarjapur Road, etc. Hosur Road, especially areas near Electronic City, are also turning into a residential hotspot.</p>
<p>For villas and row houses, Devanahalli is considered as an ideal location as a lot of residential projects are coming up in the locality. Other locations for these kind of luxury residential projects in Bangalore include Whitefield, Yelahanka, Jakkur, J P Nagar, Sarjapur Road, etc.</p>
<p>Property prices are steadily on the rise in Bangalore. For luxury apartments in Bangalore, the price starts from Rs. 1.5 crore and goes up to Rs. 12 crore and beyond. For luxury row houses and villas, ideally the price starts from Rs. 3 core and goes upward, depending on the facilities, amenities, and other such factors.</p>
<h2>Features and Amenities of Luxury Apartments in Bangalore</h2>
<p>What really differentiates a luxury residence from an affordable one? Quite a few things. Let’s take a look at some of the most important ones among them.</p>

<p>A residential community of luxury residences offer a plethora of recreational facilities for the residents such as swimming pool, gyms, spas, clubhouses, sporting facilities and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughtful Outdoor Areas </strong></p>
<p>A luxury residence gives prominence to the outdoors as well, and hence offers a range of meticulously crafted open areas such as landscaped gardens, well-crafted terraces and spacious balconies.</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Concierge and Personalised Services</strong></p>
<p>When you are hard-pressed for time, finding someone to run an errand for you would be quite a task, but not when the luxury community you live in has dedicated concierge/personalised services.</p>
<p><strong>High-end Dining and Entertainment Options</strong></p>
<p>Some of the high-end luxury residential communities offer top-notch dining and entertainment options for residents.</p>

<span>How to Calculate The Total Cost of Buying A Flat in Bangalore</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-10" class="collapse-content">
<p>Planning to buy a flat in Bangalore? Calculating the total cost of buying a flat is essential for a smooth purchasing experience &amp; a smooth move into the apartment.</p>
<p>Our lives are filled with milestones – some that we achieve effortlessly such as entering adulthood, and some others that we create for ourselves, such as owning a home or a car. To turn the dream of owning a home into reality, we often plan by carefully budgeting our expenses so that we can make a larger down payment. But it doesn’t end with just a down payment and an EMI. Homeowners end up shelling out more than just the cost of the apartment for other aspects. Here, we cover all the additional expenses that you may incur when buying your ideal home:</p>
<h2><strong>Aspects That Determine The Total Cost of Buying A Flat in Bangalore</strong></h2>
<p>A 2 BHK apartment in Bengaluru may have been purchased by you and a friend. However, there is a possibility that your friend may have paid much less than you did because of factors like the builder&#8217;s reputation, construction quality, or amenities offered. In order to better understand what a flat in Bangalore costs, let&#8217;s dig deeper:</p>
<p><strong>Construction Quality &amp; Materials Used:</strong></p>
<p>Your home&#8217;s price is directly influenced by the quality of the construction materials used. In general, high-quality homes are more expensive, but this means fewer repairs and reconstructions over time.</p>
<p><strong>Builders’ Reputation:</strong></p>
<p>A reputable builder will use good quality materials for construction. As a result, such apartments will naturally have a higher price tag as discussed earlier</p>
<p><strong>Resale Value:</strong></p>
<p>Newer properties usually fetch a higher price. However, they can still have a higher value even if they were well maintained over the years. Maintaining a property regularly can also add value.</p>
<p><strong>Location Value:</strong><br/>
<strong><br/>
</strong>A building in a commercial or market area has a higher value than one in an isolated residential area. It is common for well-developed colonies to be valued at a higher price when they are located near reputed educational institutions, hospitals, and shopping plazas.</p>
<p><strong>Amenities:</strong></p>
<p>An apartment with a number of modern amenities is valued at a higher price. A property is valued on the basis of its features associated with comfortable living. In addition to basic amenities like electrical connection, plumbing, and sewage treatment, homebuyers look for recreational amenities like parks, swimming pools, and gyms.</p>
<h2>8 Additional Expenses You Should Consider While Calculating the Total Cost of Buying A Flat in Bangalore: –</h2>
<p><strong>Stamp Duty and Registration Charges:</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an obvious expense. In order to register the property under your name, the state government charges stamp duty, which is approximately 5-7% of the property value. Then, an additional 1% of the property value must be paid to the court as registration fees.</p>
<p>If your property is valued at Rs. 1 crore, stamp duties are 5% on property values above Rs. 45 lakh. That will work out to Rs. 5 lakh. The registration charge is an additional 1% of Rs. 1 crore, which is Rs. 1 lakh. In total, you will be charged Rs. 6 lakh on stamp duty and registration charges.</p>
<p><strong>Brokerage Fee:<br/>
</strong><br/>
If you are zeroing in on your ideal home with the help of a broker, then, undoubtedly, you will spend a bit more. Both buyers and sellers will pay an agreed-upon commission to the broker for carrying out smooth transactions.Assuming you bought through a broker who charges a 2% commission on the property value, you’d have to pay him Rs. 2 lakh on a property worth Rs. 1 crore.</p>
<p><strong>Parking Cost:</strong></p>
<p>Residents of the apartments have access to a host of amenities. However, if you own two cars, you will be allotted one parking space, and you might have to pay extra for the other. This can range anywhere between Rs. 2-7 lakh per slot, depending upon the location of the slot as well as the apartment, in general.</p>
<p>Let us assume that you are charged an additional Rs. 5 lakh + 12-18% GST towards the extra parking slot.</p>
<p><strong>Interior Designs:</strong></p>
<p>You must first set a budget for how much you want to spend on interiors when you calculate the total cost spent on your home. Interiors are an essential part of your home because it adds personality to your space.</p>
<p>You can choose how your TV unit, wardrobes, bathroom fittings, and much more, need to look. Depending upon your needs, aesthetic preferences, and the quality of these products, the price can be higher or lower.</p>
<p>If you want to use materials like marble, granite, and expensive wood, then it might cost you a hefty sum that could be around Rs. 15-20 lakh. However, if you decide to opt for good quality products in a reasonable price range, then you could complete your interiors for about Rs. 5-6 lakh.</p>
<p><strong>Goods and Service Tax:</strong></p>
<p>If you purchase an under-construction property in India, you will have to pay the Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is 5%. However, if you choose a ready-to-move-in apartment that has a completion certificate, there will be no GST levied.</p>
<p><strong>Preferential Locality Charge (PLC):</strong></p>
<p>As much as garden view, sea view, pool view, or lake view apartments sound enticing, these come with an additional cost known as the Preferential Locality Charge. When you choose an apartment with a particular view or amenity in mind, you might need to pay a PLC that can vary between Rs. 100-500 per sq. ft.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance Cost Deposit:</strong></p>
<p>A maintenance cost deposit is collected by the builders to create a corpus fund. The interest on the funds would then be used for common area maintenance purposes. If the interest amount is exhausted, the tenant will be charged a maintenance charge for the following month based on the apartment SBA.</p>
<p>The maintenance deposit could be around Rs. 4-5 lakh and can even go up to Rs. 10 lakhs, Which is to be paid at the time of purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous Charges:</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the above charges, you could also incur more expenses. Some of these expenses need not necessarily add to the cost of your apartment, but they may be a factor when you purchase and move into your ideal home.</p>
<p>This could include the bank loan inspection charges that are part of the home loan amount which you will have to bear as part of the loan repayment, or it could be the expense incurred from hiring packers and movers, etc.</p>

<span>Advantages of Buying an Under-Construction Flats in Bangalore</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-12" class="collapse-content">
<p>Bengaluru is home to some of the world’s most powerful technology companies, including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Techies and entrepreneurs across India flock to the Silicon Valley of India with dreams in their eyes to make it big. With the city’s current population estimate of 11,644,000 people , there is a growing demand for real estate in Bengaluru.</p>
<p>Buyers are drawn to under-construction properties over ready-to-move-in apartments because of the numerous benefits they offer, such as lower prices, greater customisability, and flexible payment plans. With the real estate market rapidly expanding, under-construction properties appear to be a huge hit! In this blog, we cover the various advantages of buying an under-construction flat in Bengaluru.</p>
<h2>6 Advantages of Buying an Under-Construction Flat for Sale in Bangalore</h2>
<p><strong>1. Cost-Saving Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Buying an under-construction apartment in Bangalore allows you to save money because the price is usually lower than that of a ready-to-move-in flat. This means you can get more value for money and save much more on your purchase. Additionally, there are tax benefits on under-construction properties as well. They are:</p>
<p>Section 24B of the Income Tax Act of 1961: Section 24B provides an under-construction property tax benefit of up to Rs.2 lakh per financial year. This amount can be deducted from a home loan’s interest rate.</p>
<p>Section 80C of the Income Tax Act of 1961: Section 80C provides an under-construction property tax benefit of up to Rs.1.5 lakh per financial year. This amount can be deducted from the principal amount of the home loan.</p>
<p>Section 80EE of the Income Tax Act of 1961 allows taxpayers to claim an additional tax deduction of Rs.50,000 on home loan interest paid after the Section 24B limit has been reached.</p>
<p><strong>2. Customisation Options</strong></p>
<p>Modifying an under-construction flat to suit one’s needs can be an excellent option for those looking to make their home as unique as possible while also getting the best value for their money. Determine the layout and available space first while customising an under-construction flat. This will aid you in determining the kind of furniture and other items that can be installed in the flat.</p>
<p>Customised fixtures and fittings such as windows, doors, kitchen cabinets, wardrobes, and other similar items are also available to the buyer. Usually, a <a href="https://www.sobha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputed builder</a> accommodates these requests and even goes as far as advising them on the latest trends in the market.</p>
<p><strong>3. Higher Appreciation Potential</strong></p>
<p>The price of a property rises as its construction progresses. Furthermore, during this time, the development of the surrounding infrastructure increases the value of a property as well. As a result, purchasing an under-construction apartment in its earliest stages is a wise decision. For excellent return on investment, one should consider the location, upcoming infrastructure, and employment hubs nearby. Furthermore, when you buy an under-construction property in Bangalore – one of the most preferred cities for techies and entrepreneurs, you can rest assured knowing that it is one of the most lucrative places for real estate investment.</p>
<p><strong>4. Modern Amenities</strong></p>
<p>An apartment under construction ensures new amenities when it is open for occupancy. You, as a first-time occupant of the apartment, can be certain that you will be using the gym equipment or the children’s playground for the first time. This means that you will not have to deal with wear and tear in the near future. However, in ready-to-move-in apartments, these amenities may have been used by several people before you and may have worn out or been subjected to several rounds of maintenance, as well.</p>
<p><strong>5. Better Payment Options</strong></p>
<p>When purchasing a ready-to-move-in property, the buyer must mobilise large sums of money that include stamp duty, registration fees, and other miscellaneous costs. On the other hand, under-construction properties demand only the payment of a booking fee – which is around 10-15% of the total cost. You can then pay the remaining in instalments as per the construction plan. You also have time to mobilise the stamp duty and registration charges. If the property is financed, you pay EMIs to the bank.</p>
<p><strong>6. Risks And Precautions</strong></p>
<p>There could be builders who make numerous promises regarding the infrastructure and amenities they’re providing within society. However, at the time of handover, homebuyers are in for a shock as they realise that none of the promised amenities is provided. As per RERA guidelines, builders are not authorized to change the building approval plan after it has been approved and displayed on their website.</p>
<p>RERA has played a crucial role in minimizing several notorious activities, but homebuyers must consciously choose a trusted builder and a project that is RERA approved.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>When the construction of an under-construction property is completed, you will be able to enjoy a brand-new home with no maintenance issues. Furthermore, you will have access to the most recent amenities and facilities on the market.</p>
<p>Initially, homebuyers favoured ready-to-move-in properties over under-construction properties primarily to avoid possession delays. However, since the implementation of RERA, homebuyers can freely select an under-construction property as long as it has a valid RERA number and is being developed by a <a href="https://www.sobha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputable developer</a>.</p>
<p>However, do keep in mind that the under-construction flats come with a 1% GST on affordable housing and a 5% GST on non-affordable housing.</p>

<span>Affordable Luxury Homes: Mid-Income Home Buyers’ Choice</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-13" class="collapse-content">
<p>Amit Kumar works in the IT sector in Bengaluru. He has been looking for a home that matches his lifestyle requirements. However, he does not want to exceed his budget and EMIs. His estimated budget is somewhere between Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 lakh for a 2BHK home. Therefore, if Amit takes a home loan of Rs. 50 lakh, his approximate EMI would be around Rs. 44,186 per month at an interest rate of 8.75% for a period of 20 years.</p>
<p>This is well within expected range. Additionally, this EMI will come down further if the home loan amount is below Rs. 50 lakh. To fulfill their aspirations of buying a home replete with amenities, home buyers like Amit are increasingly looking at a rapidly growing segment of affordable luxury homes.</p>
<h2>Differentiating Between Affordable Luxury And Luxury Housing?</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, it is an amalgamation of modern day lifestyle and amenities that matches international standards, but at an affordable price point. For a home to be classified as affordable luxury, the price range is between Rs. 55 to 75 lakh. These homes are targeted at the mid-income home buyers. In other words, the USP of this segment is its competitive pricing for premium facilities.</p>
<p>Usually, the amenities that are a part of affordable luxury home include car parking, gymnasium, clubhouse, swimming pool and children’s play area. Additionally, the average size of these homes are in the range of 1000 sq. ft. to 1500 sq. ft. Affordable luxury homes are mostly developed as a part of integrated townships. Moreover, these projects are located in the micro-markets, which are developing at a faster pace. Affordable luxury housing as a category housing does not vie for a piece of the luxury market.</p>
<p>Luxury homes, on the other hand, usually offer world-class amenities such as swimming/infinity pool, clubhouse, gymnasium, outdoor courts for different sports, lounge, open party spaces, gardens, jogging area, amphitheatre among others.</p>
<p>On an average, luxury homes are priced at Rs. 2 crore and upwards. Such homes in the suburbs of the city may be available in the range Rs. 1 crore to Rs.1.5 crore, making the monthly EMIs anywhere between Rs. 80 thousand to Rs. 1 Lakh. However, the price of luxury home varies from city to city as well. For instance, luxury homes in Bengaluru may start from Rs. 85 lakh onwards, while in Mumbai it may start from Rs. 10 crore.</p>
<p><strong>Drivers of Affordable Luxury Housing</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, exponential urbanisation and increasing disposable income has fueled the desire of mid-income home buyers for an elevated, aspirational lifestyle. Additionally, today’s home buyers are tech-savvy, well-read and well-travelled. As a result, they are not only aware of the trends in the housing market but also acquainted with the international lifestyle standards.</p>
<p>A majority of them are first-time home buyers. More importantly, many of these home buyers are young and fall under the millennials category. According to the Youth Barometer report by <a href="https://www.credai.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CREDAI</a> and CBRE in 2018, millennials account for 25% of the working age population in emerging economies such as India and China.</p>
<p>They are expected to be important decision makers in the world of business. Further, 65% of Indian millennials aim to buy homes without compromising on the quality, size and location with a focus on quality of life. Clearly, with their focus on affordability, comfort and luxury, they will drive the demand for affordable luxury homes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a lot of NRIs are also considering to buy affordable luxury homes for investment and rental income. Various reports suggest that on an average, NRIs stand to earn a return in the range of 6% to 8% on such homes.</p>

<span>10 Benefits of Buying A Flat in Bangalore!</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-17" class="collapse-content">
<p>Bangalore, the capital <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka">city of Karnataka</a>, is famous as the technology capital, and home to numerous start-ups. The Silicon Valley of India, located approximately 3,000 feet above sea level, is a popular destination, thanks to its pleasant weather all year round and the many opportunities it provides. Since more people are moving to the city, the real estate industry has grown to meet the growing demand for housing. <a href="https://www.sobha.com/bengaluru/sobha-dream-gardens/">Buying a flat in Bangalore</a> would obviously be better than renting one if you are deciding between the two. Here are some of the benefits of owning a Flat in Bangalore.</p>
<h2><strong>10 Advantages of Buying A Flat in Bangalore</strong></h2>
<p>One doesn’t need a lot of reasons to buy a home. However, here are a few reasons why buying your property in Bangalore is advantageous.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Growing Market</strong></p>
<p>Numerous upcoming residential projects are suggestive of the ever-growing demand in the real estate industry. Since Bangalore is the start-up and IT hub, there is always an influx of people from other cities. Buying a property in a growing market such as Bangalore will be a blessing since you can allocate money towards gaining assets while avoiding paying rents.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Rental Income &amp; Better ROI</strong></p>
<p>Property investment is one of the best ways to expect safe and higher returns. Regardless of what property you buy, the returns are going to be rewarding. Especially an apartment in Bangalore can become an additional source of revenue generation if you decide to rent it out and use that money towards EMI. Should you decide to move cities at a later stage, you can always rent out the property to make additional income.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Steady Appreciation</strong></p>
<p>The population in Bangalore is on the rise, and real estate companies are in the race to provide various housing options. With the increase in real estate developments, land appreciation and apartment rates will definitely increase. Even if you sell the house in just two years, the returns will be profitable.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Affordable Home Loans</strong></p>
<p>It is now much easier to get home loans than before. With a steady source of income, you can easily avail of home loans. The process for procuring loans has also become convenient and simpler. Regardless of what tenure you look for, finding a wide range of home loans that suit all your needs, is easy. If you’re able to finalise on a property – one that is value for money and with amenities to cater to all your needs, then loans can be processed in a jiffy.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Tax Benefit Galore!</strong></p>
<p>Owning a property with a housing loan means huge tax benefits for you! A large part of your earnings would disappear without the right investments. If you want to fully enjoy your increment, and save a significant part of your tax amount, then a home loan for a property in Bangalore will surely be of great help.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Inspire To Save More</strong></p>
<p>Paying a larger down payment is a much better option than paying a higher EMI every month. Hence, the moment you’ve decided to invest in your house, you could start working towards saving more so that you can make an easy down payment. Strict monthly budgets, mutual funds, and other automated saving strategies are a great way to ensure higher savings. Even after purchasing your apartment, you will be motivated to save more so that you do not feel the burden of an EMI.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Assuring Freedom</strong></p>
<p>The fear of being evicted on short notice looms large amongst many tenants and the worry about an annual increase in the rent is also persistent. However, when you buy your own home, you have the flexibility and freedom to plan your stay. This ensures a sense of stability in homeowners.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Quality of Life &amp; Safety</strong></p>
<p>With quality housing, comes an improved quality of living. Bangalore has some of the finest residential projects that set the bar up high. Reputed builders provide homes that are par excellence in quality and lifestyle. Homes are now designed to strike a perfect balance between resort-like living while being easily accessible to reputed schools, hospitals, office spaces, and much more. With round-the-clock security, apartments, villas, and gated communities offer a sense of safety and privacy.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Community Living</strong></p>
<p>Residents of apartments gather around and celebrate festivals and other important dates. Living in an apartment instils a sense of unity and aids communal harmony. Living in an apartment is ideal for everyone – from bachelors/bachelorettes, nuclear families to senior citizens – since help is always around.</p>
<p><strong>&#8211;  Emotional Gratification</strong></p>
<p>There is nothing more gratifying than having a space to call your “own”. Anyone who has lived in a rented house knows how house owners could restrict any modifications done to their house. From simple things like gardening to hanging a photo frame, you would have to take the owner’s approval beforehand. With your own home, you can customise it the way you like and make modifications that suit your taste. You can decorate and personalise your spaces however you want them.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In a city like Bangalore, buying your own home is a sure-shot way to secure a better future. Investing in a house in Bangalore that is convenient and caters to all your requirements promotes an enriched lifestyle. There is no better time to get started on owning your perfect home, than now.

<span>8 Points to Remember Before Buying An Apartments in Bangalore.</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-18" class="collapse-content">
<p>A lot of planning, thinking, and calculations go into <a href="https://www.sobha.com/bengaluru/sobha-brooklyn-towers-town-park/">buying an apartment</a>. Financially, it’s the biggest decision you make as it would involve the lion’s share of your savings. In a city like Bangalore, finding the right apartment that suits your budget, requirements and lifestyle may seem like a daunting task. But with the right information at your fingertips, the whole process can be made a lot simpler and easier.</p>
<p>Read on and find out what are the top 8 points to tick before buying an apartments in Bangalore.</p>
<h3><strong>1. The Right Location</strong></h3>
<p>You don’t want to spend quality time negotiating the infamous traffic in Bangalore. So, ideally the right location for you is the one close to your office, your kid’s school, reputed hospitals and places you frequent. If you’re looking at an apartments as an investment, considering prime localities will ensure you a good income in terms of rent. Other aspects that need to be taken into consideration are uninterrupted supply of water and clean and green surroundings.</p>
<h3><strong>2. The Reputation</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.sobha.com/blog/indian-real-estate-is-emerging-stronger-with-the-new-normal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real estate market</a> has many players, both established and new. Besides, new entrants foray into the market from time to time. Obviously, the real task lies in choosing the right developer. Thanks to popular search engines like Google, it’s quite easy to research and find out everything about the developer that can suit your requirements: How many projects completed? Have they always delivered on time? What is the overall track record? Make sure that you go ahead only after finding satisfying answers to your questions. Choosing a <a href="https://www.sobha.com/showcase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reputed builder</a> gives you peace of mind and guarantees higher rent and resale value.</p>
<h3><strong>3. The Legal Aspects</strong></h3>
<p>Clear titles, approvals and authorisations are critical when it comes to buying an apartment. Does the property have a clear title? Has the layout been approved by the relevant authorities such as <a href="https://bmrda.karnataka.gov.in/page/Local+Planning+Areas/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bangalore Development Authority</a>, Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority or Bangalore International Airport Area Planning Authority? Does the property have a <a href="https://rera.karnataka.gov.in/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Real Estate Regulatory Authority</a> (RERA) number? If you’re investing in a property that is under construction, make sure that the developer has obtained a commencement certificate. Of course, you may find it difficult to check the veracity of all the documents and approvals. The best thing you can do is to hire a lawyer who can scrutinise all the <a href="https://www.sobha.com/blog/stamp-duty-and-property-registration-charges-in-bangalore/">relevant documents</a> including builder-buyer agreement, title deed and all other legal documents for any kind of discrepancies.</p>
<h3><strong>4. The Interaction</strong></h3>
<p>Don’t stop with the research you have done online. Before going ahead, meet people who live in the neighbourhood, or those who reside in the project complex – if you’re buying a ready-to-move-in home. Talk to your prospective neighbours, understand the locality and get a grasp of the environment. Bangalore, being a cosmopolitan city, is a potpourri of different cultures. Whether you prefer to live amidst people whose culture you’re familiar with or you want to embrace new cultures and perspectives, visiting the locality and talking to people can be of great help. To complement your face-to-face interaction, read reviews online. Together, they will provide you a better idea about your prospective house and its surroundings.</p>
<h3><strong>5. The Amenities And Facilities</strong></h3>
<p>Apartments come in all sizes and with a host of facilities – some are medium-sized with basic amenities in place, while others are sprawling and rich in amenities. Choose yours based on your lifestyle and requirements. It’s highly advisable to go for an apartment that offers amenities or facilities which you will find useful. For instance, it makes more sense to choose an apartment that has a playschool or creche in the campus if you have a little child rather than opting for one that offers fancy amenities which you are unlikely to use. Always confirm with the builder that they will provide the amenities listed out in their advertisements.</p>
<h3><strong>6. The Inspection</strong></h3>
<p>Model apartments help prospective customers to get an idea about their future home. Hence, builders set up model apartments even when the project is <a href="https://www.sobha.com/bengaluru/sobha-lake-gardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">under construction</a>. Make sure that you visit the premises, take a tour of the model apartment, and inspect every nook and cranny thoroughly and critically. If you’re buying a <a href="https://www.sobha.com/bengaluru/sobha-arena/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ready-to-move-in</a> apartments, make sure that you experience your future house in detail. Don’t hesitate to ask questions and clarify your doubts. It’s your house and it’s your responsibility to ensure that the developer has fulfilled all the promises and your house doesn’t lack anything in terms of finish and perfection.</p>
<h3><strong>7. The Floor Plan Check</strong></h3>
<p>While inspecting the apartment will give you a fair idea about your future house, it’s not enough for a fool-proof evaluation. An ideal floor plan, however, will come in handy in this regard as it will have every detail including the design and measurement of the property. Be sure that you check the floor plan thoroughly and get the help of a qualified architect to further evaluate and ensure that your house has good ventilation, and it receives plenty of natural light.</p>
<h3><strong>8. The Resale Value</strong></h3>
<p>The appreciation and resale value of an apartment greatly relies on its location as well as the amenities it offers. As far as Bangaloreans are concerned, the preferred choice is an apartments on a higher floor. Two of the most prominent advantages of living in a high-rise house are as follows: 1) They offer a panoramic view of the surroundings. 2) They are less affected by dust and pollution in comparison with apartments which are on lower floors. Yet another factor that many a buyer considers, and which will have a say in matters of appreciation and resale, is Vaastu-compliancy. It’s a wise decision to <a href="https://www.sobha.com/bengaluru/sobha-windsor-apartments-in-whitefield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opt for an apartment</a> which meets all these parameters.</p>

<span>Save up to Rs7* Lakh on Tax Deductions on Housing Loans in Bangalore</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-19" class="collapse-content">
<p>Home Loans, Tax Deductions, and Income Tax may all seem overwhelming, but we have simplified it for you! Let’s understand the benefits of home loans alongside Sunita and her husband Rajesh, who are in search of clarity on tax deductions. The couple decided to seek help from their friend Tara, who had only recently found her new home in <a href="https://www.sobha.com/bengaluru/sobha-lifestyle-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOBHA Lifestyle Legacy</a> and was now reaping benefits from several sections under the Income Tax Act after availing a house loan.</p>
<p>Tara explained to them that the Central government has put in place several benefits under various sections of the Income Tax Act to help new house buyers. Furthermore, Tara added that the discounts are in terms of loans, stamp duty and tax deductions!</p>
<p><strong>KNOW YOUR TAX DEDUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>You can get <a href="https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Pages/tools/deduction-under-section-80c.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax benefits under section 80C</a>, 80EE and 24(b) of the Income Tax Acts. These benefits not only encourage new house buyers, but also to have a substantial amount of money every year in terms of savings.</p>
<p><strong>BENEFITS UNDER SECTION 80C</strong></p>
<p>Under this section of the Income Tax Act, you can claim a tax deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh from the taxable income on the principal repayment for both self-occupied and let-out properties. Even charges for <a href="https://kaverionline.karnataka.gov.in/StampDutyCalculator/StampDutyCalculation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stamp duty and registration</a> can be claimed under this section, but only once. To claim it, you must first complete the construction of the housing property and must not sell the property within five years of possession. If the property is sold within five years after possession, any deduction claimed will be reversed in the year it is sold and be added as part of your income for the year of sale.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WITH SECTION 24</strong></p>
<p>The buyer can claim deductions up to Rs 2 lakh on the interest amount payable for a self-occupied property. However, this is only applicable upon the completion of construction within 5 years from the end of the financial year that the loan was taken. Should the project take longer to finish, then you can claim only up to Rs 30,000.</p>
<p><strong>FURTHER TAX BENEFITS UNDER SECTION 80EE</strong></p>
<p>For an additional tax benefit of Rs 1.5 lakh on the interest payments, Section 80EE comes to the rescue. However, this section is only applicable to first-time house buyers against the interest payable every financial year. Additionally, the home loan amount must not exceed Rs 35 lakh and the property’s value must be within Rs 50 lakh to avail this benefit.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION 80EEA UNDER PRADHAN MANTRI AWAS YOJANA</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://pmaymis.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana scheme</a> has been set up to make buying a house more affordable. Any individual with an annual income between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 18 lakh can apply for this scheme. Under this scheme, you can get a subsidy of up to Rs 2.67 lakh. However, neither the applicant nor any other family member must have a pucca house in any part of the country.</p>
<p><strong>ENJOY COMBINED BENEFITS ON JOINT HOUSE LOANS</strong></p>
<p>House loans taken jointly bring tax benefits to both individuals when they each claim their own deductions individually. The loan borrowers can each claim a maximum income of Rs 2 lakh on the interest paid and Rs 1.5 lakh on the principal amount, adding up to Rs 3.5 lakh. This way they can enjoy a combined benefit of a whopping Rs 7 lakh. The only prerequisite is that both individuals must be co-owners of that <a href="https://www.sobha.com/residential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">residential property</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TAX BENEFITS ON SECOND HOUSE</strong></p>
<p>Tax benefits are applicable only on the payable interests, wherein you can claim the entire interest amount paid without any cap.</p>
<p><strong>THE FARTHEST YOU CAN GO WITH DEDUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>Sunita and Rajesh know that a full tax deduction can be availed. That can be done when an individual avails a 90% loan on a property valued at Rs 45 lakh for 20 years. The interest rate must be 9% for this loan, then he/she can reap the full tax deduction of Rs 3.5 lakh.</p>
<p>They are now ready to make a confident investment into their own house. What’s even more exciting is that they have narrowed down on a flat in one of the upcoming projects of <a href="https://www.sobha.com/bengaluru/sobha-windsor-apartments-in-whitefield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOBHA Limited – SOBHA Windsor</a> It’s your turn next.</p>

<span>Stamp Duty & Registration Charges in Bangalore – A Quick Reckoner for House Buyers </span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-20" class="collapse-content">
<p><a href="https://www.sobha.com/blog/advantages-of-buying-house-in-bangalore/">Buying a house</a> involves quite a lot of procedures and attracts a slew of statutory charges. It’s always better to know about these in advance, particularly about the latter, to avoid unpleasant surprises later on. Let’s get to know in detail about the stamp duty and registration charges applicable, when <a href="https://www.sobha.com/bengaluru/sobha-brooklyn-towers-town-park/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buying a house in Bangalore</a>.</p>
<p>Stamp duty and registration charges vary from state to state. More importantly, these charges make your house costlier. But what exactly are stamp duty and registration charges? Section 3 of the Indian Stamp Act 1899 mandates the collection of these charges for the following reasons:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">1) To authenticate the sale agreement.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">2) To maintain a record of the property. It’s the state government that decides and fixes all charges that are collected towards stamp duty and registration.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Gamut of Property Charges</h2>
<p>Let us assume that Anita is buying a property worth Rs 80 lakh in a posh locality in Bangalore. She will pay this sum to the seller and stamp duty, registration charges, surcharge (which is a tax levied on tax), and cess (a form of tax over and above the base tax liability of the taxpayer).</p>
<p>Anita will be charged stamp duty at 5.6% of the property cost, which will come up to Rs 4,48,000. Furthermore, the state government will levy registration charges at 1% of the property value, amounting to Rs 80,000. Anita will also have to pay a cess charged at 10% of the stamp duty, amounting to Rs 44,800, and another surcharge calculated at 2% of the stamp duty, which will come up to Rs. 8960.</p>
<p>So, while Anita’s property will cost Rs.80 lakh, the additional charges will add up to Rs 5,81,760. Therefore, the total cost of her property value will be Rs 85,81,760 plus GST.</p>

Between Rs. 21 &amp; Rs. 35 lakh    3%<br/>
Above Rs. 35 lakh    5%</p>
<h2><strong>What Are The Parameters That Determine Stamp Duty Charges?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Age of the Property:</strong></p>
<p>Stamp duty is calculated based on the total value of the property you are purchasing. Since with age properties register depreciation, the age of the property has a prominent role to play in determining the stamp duty. Precisely the reason why older properties are easier on the pocket in terms of stamp duty when compared with brand new ones.</p>
<p><strong>Buyer’s Age:</strong></p>
<p>If you are a senior citizen, you’ve reasons to cheer while buying a house. Yes, senior citizens pay a lesser amount in terms of stamp duty whereas people of younger age get no relaxation, and hence end up paying more.</p>
<p><strong>Gender:</strong></p>
<p>Yet another factor that has a say in stamp duty is gender. In most states, Women, in comparison to men, pay a lesser stamp duty – roughly 2% lesser than men. However, in Bangalore the rate is same for both men and women.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Property:</strong></p>
<p>While there is no escape from stamp duty, residential properties have an advantage. They, in comparison with commercial properties, attract a lesser amount in terms of stamp duty.</p>
<p><strong>Location:</strong></p>
<p>Buying a house in an urban area? Be prepared to pay a higher sum as stamp duty. However, if your plan is to buy a house in a semi-urban or rural area, you pay a lesser amount.</p>
<p><strong>Amenities:</strong></p>
<p>Does the house you are planning to buy have a host of amenities? Well, shell out more towards stamp duty. It is simple – the more amenities you have, the more you pay. If your house has a swimming pool, library, gym or even elevators, you will have to spend more money on stamp duty.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Paying Property Charges</strong></p>
<p>Property charges prove to be beneficial to home buyers as it ensures the following, under Section 3 of the Indian Stamp Act 1899:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>1)</strong> The property is now confirmed to you &#8211; Upon paying the property registration charges, the property will legally be under your name. This crucial document authenticates the sale and makes you the new owner of that property.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>2)</strong> Maintenance of records &#8211; You pay registration charges so that the Government keeps a record of the property. Without this, the previous owner will continue to be considered the owner of the property.</p>
<p><strong>Understanding Stamp Duty Charges</strong></p>
<p>Stamp Duty and Registration Charges ensure that the property is legally transferred to you. These charges are applicable on all kinds of properties, be it under-construction, newly completed, or re-sale.</p>
<p>Stamp Duty is payable on the value of the property or on the circle rate, whichever is higher. A circle rate is the price of property or land in a region that is published and regulated by the State Government. Stamp duty on registration of various instruments is imposed under the provisions of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.</p>
<p>The Stamp Duty is called so because the stamp mark on the documents implies that the paper has assumed approval of the authorities and is now of legal significance. Stamp duty is also applicable on conveyance deeds, sale deeds, and power of attorney papers, but the charges vary in different states.</p>
<h2><strong>Documents Required to Pay Stamp Duty</strong></h2>
<p>The buyer must submit a host of documents at the time of property registration, depending on the type of property. These are some important documents to be arranged at the time of registration:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">• Sale agreement<br/>
• Sale deed<br/>
• Khata certificate<br/>
• Photocopy of society share certificate and society registration certificate (in case of housing project)<br/>
• NOC from the apartment association (in case of housing project)<br/>
• Sanctioned building plan (under-construction property)<br/>
• Builder-buyer agreement (under-construction property)<br/>
• Possession letter from the builder (under-construction property)<br/>
• Title documents of the landowner (in case of land purchase)<br/>
• Records of Rights and Tenancy Corps or 7/12 extract (in case of land purchase)<br/>
• Conversion order (in case of land purchase)<br/>
• Tax paid receipts of the last 3 months<br/>
• Registered development agreement (in case of joint development property)<br/>
• Power of attorney/s (if applicable)<br/>
• Joint development agreement between landowner and builder (in case of joint development property)<br/>
• Copies of all registered agreements (in case of resale property)<br/>
• Latest bank statements in case of any outstanding loan amount<br/>
• Encumbrance certificate</p>
<p><strong>Reason Behind Registration Charges</strong></p>
<p>While Stamp Duty is paid to transfer the property to your name, Registration Charges are paid as per the Registration Act, 1908, to the Government to maintain it in its registry. This must be done within four months from the date of execution after the stamp duty is paid.</p>
<p>Unless the registration is complete, an entitlement of the property is invalid, and the property will still be under the previous owner’s name. Hence, it is important to register the property in the Sub Registrar of Assurances of the Jurisdiction’s office, where the property is purchased.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Calculate the Registration Fee &amp; Stamp Duty?</strong></h2>
<p>These two factors are calculated based on different types of properties depending upon different city laws.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&#8211; Super built-up area is considered for calculation for multistorey apartments<br/>
&#8211; Charges on individual houses are calculated as per the constructed area<br/>
&#8211; For plots, the sq. ft area of the plot is multiplied by the predominant guideline value of that area</p>
<p>Whether you are opting for a budget house or a luxury house, whether your choice of location is an urban setting or a rural area, knowing about the charges towards stamp duty helps you greatly. One of the most important advantages is that it lets you be in control, in terms of budget. Make sure that you do your research thoroughly before buying your house.</p>

<span>Key Documents to Check before Buying a House in Bangalore – A Handy Guide!</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-21" class="collapse-content">
<p>So, finally, after pondering for months following consultations with family and friends, you have made up your mind to go ahead and buy your house. Congratulations! You have made the right choice. Mind you, this is one of the most important financial decisions in your life.</p>
<p>You might have weighed the pros and cons in all its detail, no matter what they are. Before going ahead any further, a word of caution: check all the documents that you ought to check at each stage with utmost care. If you think that you cannot verify it all by yourself, do not hesitate to seek professional help. After all, it’s your hard-earned money, and you don’t want to take any chance.</p>
<p>Buying a house, of course, is a nuanced procedure and documents are integral to it. Let’s delve into the details of what documents you need to check before buying a house. As you are aware, asking questions and eliciting satisfying answers are of vital importance while buying a house.</p>
<h2>Documents To Check Before Buying A Flat in Bangalore</h2>
<p><strong>Layout Approval</strong> –</p>
<p>Does the property you are planning to buy have a valid layout approval? If yes, you’ve nothing to be concerned about. But if it’s a no, it’s not advisable to move forward, because buying a property without a valid layout approval will cause you trouble in future. In Karnataka, layouts are approved under provisions of Karnataka Town &amp; Country Planning Act 1961 and Karnataka Urban Development Authority Act 1987.</p>
<p><strong>Master Plan –</strong></p>
<p>Where exactly is your house in the city? What conveniences are available in the vicinity? Checking the city’s masterplan will help you find answers to these. But there is more to a city’s masterplan. It will help you find out any inconsistencies or irregularities in comparison with what you have been promised by the builder. The master plan, without fail, showcases even the minutest detail regarding the infrastructure around the property you intend to purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Land Records – </strong></p>
<p>It’s the most important of all the documents. A proper land document gives all the details of the land including pending loans and ownership details. It is important to verify it in detail as any discrepancy will result in legal complications in future. Verifying land records is easier now, thanks to the Digital India Land Record Modernisation Programme (DILRMP) launched by the government of India in 2008. Karnataka being the first state to digitalise all its land records, now offers easy availability of them online.</p>
<p><strong>Land Use Certificate &#8211; </strong></p>
<p>Land is categorised into different segments such as commercial land, agricultural land, etc. It’s not permissible to build residential property on lands earmarked for commercial or agricultural purpose. A land use certificate, also known as change of land use (CLU), is issued to the developer. Make sure that you check the land use certificate from your builder thoroughly for any discrepancies to ensure that your purchase is valid and trouble-free.</p>
<p><strong>Occupancy Certificate</strong> –</p>
<p>As the name suggests, an occupancy certificate (OC) is a guarantee that the house you are purchasing has all the basic amenities in place including water, electricity and drainage system. Ask for your occupancy certificate and scrutinise it further to make sure that the whole process of purchasing your house is truly transparent.</p>
<p><strong>Allotment Letter – </strong></p>
<p>Issued by the builder once the advance is made, the allotment letter is a crucial document that comprises an array of information pertaining to the purchase. The most vital information that an allotment letter will have, includes the following: payment, terms of construction, construction schedule, amenities, the final amount that must be paid to the builder, the delivery date and the builder’s liability if there is a delay in delivering the project as promised.</p>
<p><strong>No Objection Certificate – </strong></p>
<p>First things first – it’s unlawful to sell a property without obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC). An NOC is given to the builder by various departments that deal with safety, water, electricity supply, etc. Asking for an NOC is a matter of critical importance before you make any payment towards the purchase of your house.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate of Commencement – </strong></p>
<p>Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) issues the certificate of commencement. This certificate is a proof that the concerned authorities have inspected the construction site and find it satisfactory to give the nod. Obtaining certificate of commencement is mandatory for builders to start any type of construction.</p>
<p><strong>Completion Certificate – </strong></p>
<p>A completion certificate is issued by the local authorities after verifying that a property is built based on the approved plan and complying to all the necessary standards set by the local development authority. Some of the most important details furnished in a completion certificate are details of the land, building plan, builder details, approved height of the building, the location and the building’s distance from other buildings in the vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>Builder-Buyer Agreement – </strong></p>
<p>It’s quite important to read the builder-buyer agreement thoroughly before signing it. A typical builder-buyer agreement will have a construction timeline, price escalation clause, change in the area of the apartment and payment delay. While all these are important, particularly pay attention to the clause related to payment delay as it can result in you paying a hefty sum if you delay the payment.</p>
<p><strong>Sale Deed Registration – </strong></p>
<p>Once the project is completed, you need to obtain the sale deed registration from the registrar’s office. Considered as the ownership document, it is important that you go through the sale deed in detail before purchasing the property.</p>
<p><strong>Possession Certificate – </strong></p>
<p>The final one that is awarded to you, the possession certificate validates the ownership of the property. It is given once you have moved into your new house.</p>
<p><em>Now you know what documents and certificates you need to obtain and inspect thoroughly before buying a house. Remember, the whole process of scrutinising these documents can be exhausting. If you think that you will not be able to do it all by yourself, reach out to a professional. Make sure that you take zero chances to make your homebuying experience smooth and transparent.</em></p>

<span>JOINT CO-OWNERSHIP OF HOUSE PROPERTY LEADS TO SUPER SAVINGS</span>
</h2>
<div id="faq-23" class="collapse-content">
<p>Your wife may be a superwoman who knows what time she has a meeting without checking her calendar, where your office folders are ahead of your presentation, and is well aware of the children’s exam dates. But did you know she can save a ton of money if you decide to register the house property under her name or opt for co-ownership? Women gain a huge advantage when it comes to Property Investment as well as Income Tax.</p>
<p>Wondering what we’re talking about? Well, from a tax deduction to reduced stamp duty, you and your wife can save a fortune if you decide to co-own or make your wife the primary owner of your housing property. A big decision such as buying your house may already take a lot of your time and effort. Don’t shell out more money too! Simply register the property in your wife’s name or apply for joint ownership.</p>
<p><strong>SAVE UP TO Rs 3.5 LAKH ON INCOME TAX</strong></p>
<p>Under section 80C, you and your wife can claim tax deductions of up to Rs 1.5 lakh every financial year for the principal you pay jointly, provided the house is self-occupied / vacant. You can further claim Rs 2 lakh for the interest you both pay. The tax deductions are dependent on the ownership share between the couple. If your wife is a first-time home buyer, then she can claim an additional Rs 50,000 for the principal amount she repays. If your wife is a home-maker and claims deductions, it is void.</p>
<p><strong>WOMEN ENJOY 2% LESSER STAMP DUTY CHARGES</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sobha.com/blog/stamp-duty-and-property-registration-charges-in-bangalore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stamp duty charges</a> are higher for men, and this integral aspect of buying house property cannot be ignored. The government has allocated lower rates for women in many parts of India. In places like Haryana, men pay 6% as Stamp Duty charges, while women pay only 4%. While the percentage difference is only 2%, there is a large saving when it translates into monetary value.</p>
<p><strong>GET DISCOUNTS ON HOUSE LOAN INTERESTS</strong></p>
<p>Women owners are offered discounts on <a href="https://www.sobha.com/blog/how-to-reduce-your-home-loan-interest-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">housing loan interest rates</a>. Several banks such as SBI, ICICI, HDFC and many more offer lower interest rates to women. The amount of discount varies from one bank to another and can come down significantly.</p>
<p>If your wife has no source of income, and yet you register the housing property under her name, it can be deemed as Benami. We hope this information will help you to make a fully informed decision of how you want to register your property and save on continuous basis.</p>
