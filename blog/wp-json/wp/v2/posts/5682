The scope of RERA encompasses residential real estate projects, and its objectives are multifold.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, the act aims to promote fair practices by developers, ensuring that property buyers receive what was promised within stipulated timelines. It requires builders to register their projects with the authority and disclose crucial information, making project details accessible to potential buyers.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, RERA addresses the longstanding issue of fund diversion, by mandating that developers deposit significant portion of project funds in an escrow account \u2013 thus preventing misuse.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Need of RERA Regulation<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>RERA provides a structured framework for property transactions, ultimately fostering trust and accountability. It has transformed the real estate sector into a buyer-centric, organised, and transparent domain, aligning with India&#8217;s goal of a developed and ethical real estate landscape.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Key Provisions of the RERA Act<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>RERA is a legislative shield designed to protect the interests of homebuyers and usher in transparency and fairness within the real estate industry. This brings to the forefront a comprehensive set of provisions and salient features that redefine the dynamics of property transactions.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Salient_Features_of_the_RERA_Act\"><\/span><strong>Salient Features of the RERA Act<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Establishment of RERA authority in every Indian state to monitor and arbitrate projects in the concerned form<\/li>\n<li>Each real estate project needs to be registered with the RERA authority. If guidelines have been adhered to, the authority can accept the project&#8217;s registration.<\/li>\n<li>Establishment of a fast-track mechanism to settle the disputes<\/li>\n<li>To gain RERA approval for transferring rights &amp; liabilities of a real estate project to a third party, the promoter must obtain written consent from at least 2\/3rd of the project&#8217;s allottees<\/li>\n<li>In cases where the promoter&#8217;s actions result in financial losses for a buyer due to third parties asserting claims on the under-construction property, the promoter is obligated to provide compensation to the affected buyer. If there is any default from the promoter or buyer side, they must pay an equal interest rate.<\/li>\n<li>If a person has any problem regarding violation of the rules of this Act by an agent, buyer or promoter, they can file a complaint<\/li>\n<li>If a promoter fails to follow RERA rules, they will have to pay the penalty amount, which could be up to 5% of the evaluated cost of the property<\/li>\n<li>If any of RERA authority&#8217;s decisions for any complaint is unsatisfactory, one can submit their appeal to the Appellate Tribunal<\/li>\n<li>A penalty must be paid if the Appellate Tribunal&#8217;s order is not complied with. This can be imprisonment for up to 3 years or 10% of the approximate cost of the project.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Properties_of_RERA_Act\"><\/span><strong>Properties of RERA Act<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Security:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Under this Act, at least 70% of the buyers\u2019 and investors\u2019 money will be kept in an escrow account. This money will be allotted to the builder for land-related costs and construction. Builders can only request up to 10% of the property&#8217;s price as an advance payment.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Quality:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Developers must rectify any issues the homebuyers face within 5 years of purchase. This should be rectified within one month of the complaint.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Transparency:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Builders must submit original documents for all the projects they undertake. If they need to change the plans, they can do so only with the buyers&#8217; consent.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Authorisation:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The regulator cannot advertise, build, invest, sell, or book a plot without making a registration with the regulator. Once registration is done, the project gets a unique RERA number, which needs to be mentioned in all advertisements &amp; promotions.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Role_of_RERA\"><\/span><strong>Role of RERA<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>At the state level, the Regulatory Authority comprising experts from various fields, is responsible for the Act&#8217;s enforcement within the respective state&#8217;s jurisdiction. They are pivotal in ensuring compliance with RERA provisions, including project registrations, information disclosures, and adherence to project timelines. These authorities are the go-to resource for aggrieved homebuyers seeking redressal of grievances related to project delays, quality issues, or violations of RERA norms.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, RERA authorities are entrusted with maintaining a publicly accessible database of registered projects, promoting transparency. They act as the judges between developers &amp; buyers, facilitating smoother transactions and dispute resolutions.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Enforcement of compliance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The RERA Authority can impose penalties, revoke project registrations, and even recommend criminal proceedings against non-compliant builders. This proactive approach is a powerful deterrent against fraudulent practices, ensuring that the interests of homebuyers are adequately protected.<\/p>\n<p>RERA authorities, both at the state and union territory levels, serve as the watchdogs of India&#8217;s real estate sector. In essence, they empower homebuyers, foster transparency, and uphold the principles of fairness &amp; accountability \u2013 as laid out in the Act.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Types_of_RERA_Registration\"><\/span><strong>Types of RERA Registration<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<table>\n<tbody class=\"with-border\">\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">\n<h3><strong>Project Registration<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">\n<h3><strong>Promoter Registration<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">\n<h3><strong>Real Estate Agent Registration<\/strong><\/h3>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">It is mandatory for promoters to get their project registered under RERA for selling the units to the buyers<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">The promoters have to make an application to get enlisted under RERA act<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">It is compulsory to get themselves registered with RERA<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"208\">Promoters will have to submit the application with required documents and pay the given amount of fees<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">A promoter shows his own data with his project details<\/td>\n<td width=\"208\">&#8211;<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Registration_of_Real_Estate_Projects_Under_the_RERA_Estate_Act_2016\"><\/span><strong>Registration of Real Estate Projects Under the RERA Estate Act 2016<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The application process for real estate projects varies from one state to another.

Initiate the registration process by providing basic information such as name, email address, and mobile number.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Application Form Completion<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>After successfully creating an account, one must complete the application form. This form solicits comprehensive details regarding the project, encompassing its location, dimensions, unit count, and anticipated completion date.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Document Upload<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Following the application form submission, the next step is uploading essential documents. These documents encompass the title deed, building plan, and land-use certificate.

The applicant will receive a registration certificate if all details align with the regulatory requirements.

Developers must register their projects, disclosing critical details such as timelines, layouts, approvals, and financial particulars. This information is readily available to the public, enabling potential buyers to take informed decisions.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Consumer_Protection_under_RERA\"><\/span><strong>Consumer Protection under RERA<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>RERA&#8217;s commitment to consumer protection is exemplified through its grievance redressal mechanism, which empowers consumers to voice concerns and seek resolution in case of dissatisfaction with the project. The mechanism offers a structured and efficient path for addressing grievances, providing an avenue for fair &amp; timely resolutions.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, RERA mandates stringent penalties for developers who fail to meet their obligations or indulge in fraudulent practices, reinforcing its commitment to consumer protection. Developers must adhere to project delivery timelines &amp; quality standards, and provide accurate information to homebuyers.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Challenges_and_Criticisms\"><\/span><strong>Challenges and Criticisms<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>One notable challenge lies in the inconsistent adoption &amp; implementation of RERA across states &amp; union territories. Differences in interpretation and varying rules have resulted in non-uniformity, making it essential to streamline and harmonise the application of RERA nationwide.<\/p>\n<p>The delayed establishment of regulatory authorities and the absence of permanent appellate tribunals have hindered resolution of disputes, impacting developers &amp; homebuyers. Addressing these delays by expediting the setting up of these bodies is crucial.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Latest_Changes_on_RERA_ACT_since_its_implementation\"><\/span><strong>Latest Changes on RERA ACT since its implementation<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Since its implementation, the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 has undergone several changes &amp; announcements to enhance its efficacy and address emerging issues in India&#8217;s real estate sector.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One noteworthy development is the increasing coverage of real estate projects under RERA&#8217;s purview<\/li>\n<li>Many states have moved to include ongoing projects previously excluded, ensuring that a more comprehensive range of properties falls within the regulatory framework<\/li>\n<li>Developers are now required to provide details about the status of the land title, updates on project progress, and quarterly updates on the project&#8217;s financials<\/li>\n<li>Several states have established permanent appellate tribunals to expedite the resolution of disputes, providing a dedicated platform for aggrieved parties to seek redressal<\/li>\n<li>Certain states have introduced digital initiatives, such as online project registration and grievance redressal portals, simplifying processes for developers &amp; homebuyers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Impact_of_RERA_on_the_Real_Estate_Sector\"><\/span><strong>Impact of RERA on the Real Estate Sector<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This government initiative has had several far-reaching impacts on the sector:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Mandatory Project Registration:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Under RERA, all residential and commercial real estate projects exceeding 500 sq m or 8 apartments must register with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). Builders must provide comprehensive project details \u2013 including layouts, sanctioned plans, exact project locations, garage space specifications, and carpet area.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Construction Progress Updates:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This includes quarterly updates on the number &amp; types of flats sold, completion schedules, and litigation details if any<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Standardised Sale Agreement: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>This includes details like possession dates, internal &amp; external development work specifications, and construction specifics \u2013 thus reducing the risk of hidden charges or penalties for buyers<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Accurate Carpet Area:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To eliminate confusion, RERA requires builders to disclose the apartment area based on the carpet area rather than the super-built area. This ensures that buyers pay for what they receive.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Defect Liability Period: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Builders must rectify structural defects and issues arising from poor construction quality for 5 years. If they fail, homebuyers can file a complaint with the authority.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Timely Possession Guarantee: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In cases of delayed possession, builders are liable to refund the entire amount or pay interest to the homebuyer for the delay period. This incentivises timely project completion.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Approval for Alterations: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Builders require approval from homebuyers for any alterations in flats or the project&#8217;s layout and common areas. In the latter case, support from two-thirds of total buyers is mandatory.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Grievance Redressal: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>RERA introduces a streamlined grievance redressal mechanism. Buyers, developers, or promoters can file complaints. The state real estate regulatory department aims to resolve issues within 60 days. If parties are dissatisfied, they can appeal to the Appellate Tribunal and, ultimately the High Court or Supreme Court if necessary.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Final_Thoughts\"><\/span><strong>Final Thoughts<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In summary, RERA and its rules represent a watershed moment for India&#8217;s real estate sector. This progressive regulatory framework has ushered in an era of transparency, accountability, and fairness that benefits all stakeholders. RERA&#8217;s insistence on project registration, regular updates, standardised agreements, and accurate area calculations has empowered homebuyers \u2013 shielding them from hidden costs and ensuring they receive fair value.<\/p>\n<p>With provisions like the defect liability period and stringent penalties for non-compliance, RERA enforces quality standards &amp; timely project completion. This not only boosts investor and consumer confidence but also attracts more investments, propelling the growth of the real estate sector.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"FAQs\"><\/span><strong>FAQs<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n        <section class=\"sc_fs_faq sc_card \">\n            <div>\n\t\t\t\t<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"1_What_is_the_RERA_Act_2016\"><\/span>1.
