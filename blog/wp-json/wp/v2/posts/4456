So, ideally the right location for you is the one close to your office, your kid\u2019s school, reputed hospitals and places you frequent.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking at<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/property\/2-bhk-flats-in-bangalore-for-sale\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> an apartment as an investment<\/a>, considering prime localities will ensure you a good income in terms of rent. Other aspects that need to be taken into consideration are uninterrupted supply of water and clean and green surroundings.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Reputation\"><\/span><strong>The Reputation:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The real estate market has many players, both established and new. Besides, new entrants foray into the market from time to time. Obviously, the real task lies in choosing the right developer. Thanks to popular search engines like Google, it\u2019s quite easy to research and find out everything about the developer that can suit your requirements:<br \/>\nHow many projects completed?<br \/>\nHave they always delivered on time?<br \/>\nWhat is the overall track record?<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that you go ahead only after finding satisfying answers to your questions. Choosing a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">reputed builder<\/a> gives you peace of mind and guarantees higher rent and resale value.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Legal_Aspects\"><\/span><strong>The Legal Aspects:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Clear titles, approvals and authorisations are critical when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/city\/bengaluru\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">buying an apartment<\/a>. Does the property have a clear title? Has the layout been approved by the relevant authorities such as <a href=\"https:\/\/bmrda.karnataka.gov.in\/page\/Local+Planning+Areas\/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bangalore Development Authority<\/a>, Bangalore Metropolitan Region Development Authority or Bangalore International Airport Area Planning Authority? Does the property have a <a href=\"https:\/\/rera.karnataka.gov.in\/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Real Estate Regulatory Authority<\/a> (RERA) number?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re investing in a property that is under construction, make sure that the developer has obtained a commencement certificate. Of course, you may find it difficult to check the veracity of all the documents and approvals. The best thing you can do is to hire a lawyer who can scrutinise all the relevant documents including builder-buyer agreement, title deed and all other legal documents for any kind of discrepancies.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Interaction\"><\/span><strong>The Interaction:<br \/>\n<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t stop with the research you have done online. Before going ahead, meet people who live in the neighbourhood, or those who reside in the project complex \u2013 if you\u2019re buying a ready-to-move-in home. Talk to your prospective neighbours, understand the locality and get a grasp of the environment.<\/p>\n<p>Bangalore, being a cosmopolitan city, is a potpourri of different cultures. Whether you prefer to live amidst people whose culture you\u2019re familiar with or you want to embrace new cultures and perspectives, visiting the locality and talking to people can be of great help. To complement your face-to-face interaction, read reviews online. Together, they will provide you a better idea about your prospective house and its surroundings.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Amenities_And_Facilities\"><\/span><strong>The Amenities And Facilities:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Apartments come in all sizes and with a host of facilities \u2013 some are medium-sized with basic amenities in place, while others are sprawling and rich in amenities. Choose yours based on your lifestyle and requirements. It\u2019s highly advisable to go for an apartment that offers amenities or facilities which you will find useful.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, it makes more sense to choose an apartment that has a playschool or creche in the campus if you have a little child rather than opting for one that offers fancy amenities which you are unlikely to use. Always confirm with the builder that they will provide the amenities listed out in their advertisements.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Inspection\"><\/span><strong>The Inspection:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Model apartments help prospective customers to get an idea about their future home. Hence, builders set up model apartments even when the project is under construction. Make sure that you visit the premises, take a tour of the model apartment, and inspect every nook and cranny thoroughly and critically.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re buying a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/bengaluru\/sobha-clovelly\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">ready-to-move-in apartment<\/a>, make sure that you experience your future house in detail. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions and clarify your doubts. It\u2019s your house and it\u2019s your responsibility to ensure that the developer has fulfilled all the promises and your house doesn\u2019t lack anything in terms of finish and perfection.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Floor_Plan_Check\"><\/span><strong>The Floor Plan Check:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While inspecting the apartment will give you a fair idea about your future house, it\u2019s not enough for a fool-proof evaluation. An ideal floor plan, however, will come in handy in this regard as it will have every detail including the design and measurement of the property.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure that you check the floor plan thoroughly and get the help of a qualified architect to further evaluate and ensure that your house has good ventilation, and it receives plenty of natural light.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"The_Resale_Value\"><\/span><strong>The Resale Value:<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The appreciation and resale value of an apartment greatly relies on its location as well as the amenities it offers. As far as Bangaloreans are concerned, the preferred choice is an apartment on a higher floor.<\/p>\n<p>Two of the most prominent advantages of living in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/bengaluru\/sobha-hrc-pristine\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">high-rise house<\/a> are as follows:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1)<\/strong> They offer a panoramic view of the surroundings.<br \/>\n<strong>2)<\/strong> They are less affected by dust and pollution in comparison with apartments which are on lower floors. Yet another factor that many a buyer considers, and which will have a say in matters of appreciation and resale, is Vaastu-compliancy. It\u2019s a wise decision to opt for an apartment which meets all these parameters.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"SOBHA_%E2%80%93_The_Advantages\"><\/span><strong>SOBHA \u2013 The Advantages<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A name synonymous with quality, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOBHA Ltd<\/a>., offers an array of apartments across Bangalore.
