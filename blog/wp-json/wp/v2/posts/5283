CIBIL is India\u2019s first credit information company authorised by the Reserve Bank of India. It collects credit information from different financial institutions and creates credit reports for individuals, which contains details such as credit utilisation, credit history, repayment behaviors, and more. Based on this information, CIBIL calculates the credit score of an individual, which ranges between 300 &amp; 900. Anything above 750 is considered a good CIBIL score for a home loan.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Factors_Considered_while_Calculating_CIBIL_Score\"><\/span><strong>Factors Considered while Calculating CIBIL Score<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Credit Payment History:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>To maintain a good record of credit payment history, timely payment of credit card bills and loan EMIs play an important role.

However, a CIBIL score of 700 and above is considered good for securing a home loan.

This indicates lower risk for the lender, and hence increases the chances of loan approval.<\/p>\n<p>While a high CIBIL score improves your chances of loan approval, it does not guarantee it, as lenders also consider other factors during the loan approval process.

On the other hand, a low CIBIL score may raise concerns for lenders as it suggests a higher credit risk. Lenders may hesitate to approve a home loan application if the CIBIL score is low.

The relationship between CIBIL score and home loan eligibility can be summarised as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Loan Approval<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A higher score is an indication of excellent creditworthiness, implying that a borrower is highly likely to repay the loan regularly, and within the loan tenure.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Interest Rates:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A higher CIBIL score can also help you secure a lower interest rate on your home loan. Lenders often offer better terms and conditions, including reduced interest rates, to individuals with good credit scores.

While evaluating a home loan application, lenders consider different factors to check your creditworthiness, among which CIBIL Score is most important.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to home loans, a high CIBIL score can have a significant impact on the loan amount you can secure. Lenders want to lend to borrowers with higher scores, as they are perceived as less risky. Due to good credit score, a borrower may be eligible for higher loan amount. A higher CIBIL score increases the chance of loan approval with better interest rates &amp; terms.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, a low CIBIL score implies higher credit risk, hence can adversely affect a borrower\u2019s home loan prospects. Banks and financial institutions may be reluctant to lend larger amounts, or may offer the loan at higher interest rates.
