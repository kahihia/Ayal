Since with age properties register depreciation, the age of the property has a prominent role to play in determining the stamp duty. Precisely the reason why older properties are easier on the pocket in terms of stamp duty when compared with brand new ones.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Buyer\u2019s Age:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you are a senior citizen, you\u2019ve reasons to cheer while <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/residential\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">buying a house<\/a>. Yes, senior citizens pay a lesser amount in terms of stamp duty whereas people of younger age get no relaxation, and hence end up paying more.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Gender:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Yet another factor that has a say in stamp duty is gender. In most states, Women, in comparison to men, pay a lesser stamp duty \u2013 roughly 2% lesser than men. However, in Bangalore the rate is same for both men and women.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Type Of Property:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>While there is no escape from stamp duty, residential properties have an advantage. They, in comparison with commercial properties, attract a lesser amount in terms of stamp duty.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Location:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Buying a house in an urban area? Be prepared to pay a higher sum as stamp duty. However, if your plan is to buy a house in a semi-urban or rural area, you pay a lesser amount.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Amenities:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Does the house you are planning to buy have a host of amenities? Well, shell out more towards stamp duty. It is simple \u2013 the more amenities you have, the more you pay. If your house has a swimming pool, library, gym or even elevators, you will have to spend more money on stamp duty.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Must Read:<\/strong> <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/joint-co-ownership-of-house-property-leads-to-super-savings\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joint Co-Ownership of House Property Leads To Super Savings!<\/a><\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Benefits_of_Paying_Property_Charges\"><\/span><strong>Benefits of Paying Property Charges<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Property charges prove to be beneficial to home buyers as it ensures the following, under Section 3 of the Indian Stamp Act 1899:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"padding-left: 40px;\"><strong>1) The Property is Now Confirmed to You &#8211;<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Upon paying the property registration charges, the property will legally be under your name.

A circle rate is the price of property or land in a region that is published and regulated by the <a href=\"https:\/\/kaverionline.karnataka.gov.in\/StampDutyCalculator\/StampDutyCalculation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">State Government<\/a>. Stamp duty on registration of various instruments is imposed under the provisions of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899.<\/p>\n<p>The Stamp Duty is called so because the stamp mark on the documents implies that the paper has assumed approval of the authorities and is now of legal significance.
