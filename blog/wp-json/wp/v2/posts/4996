You can avail home loans from banks, housing finance companies, or non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Taking a home loan involves several steps and can seem daunting, but it gets a lot easier when you have your loan pre-approved.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-pre-approval\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loan pre-approval<\/a> is an important step in the home-buying process. Pre-approval provides a potential homebuyer with several advantages. This includes the ability to make an offer on a home with confidence and the advantage of being able to shop for a home with a specific budget.<\/p>\n<p>The pre-approval process begins with a homebuyer providing information about their income, assets, debts, and credit history, to a lender (i.e. a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_banks_in_India\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bank<\/a> \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/nhb.org.in\/list-of-housing-finance-companies-granted-certificate\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">housing finance company<\/a> \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/commonperson\/English\/Scripts\/FAQs.aspx?Id=1167\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NBFC<\/a>). The lender will then review this information and based on their criteria, will provide a loan approval or pre-approval. This approval will specify the maximum amount a buyer can borrow, the loan type, and the interest rate.<\/p>\n<p>Having a pre-approval letter in hand gives homebuyers several advantages. First, it informs sellers that the buyer is serious and financially capable of buying the property. This can be an advantage in a competitive market, where sellers may choose to accept an offer from a pre-approved buyer. Second, a pre-approval letter gives the buyer confidence that they can purchase the property. Finally, this entire process helps the buyer determine a realistic budget for their home purchase.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In this blog, we look at the entire home loan process and how you can avail a loan<\/strong><\/p>\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_63 ez-toc-wrap-left counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-custom ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<p class=\"ez-toc-title \" >Table of Contents<\/p>\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#How_to_Get_Started_With_Home_Loan_Process\" title=\"How to Get Started With Home Loan Process\">How to Get Started With Home Loan Process<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-3' ><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Step_1_Calculate_your_Home_Loan_Eligibility\" title=\"Step 1: Calculate your Home Loan Eligibility\">Step 1: Calculate your Home Loan Eligibility<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Step_2_Choose_the_Home_Loan_Provider\" title=\"Step 2: Choose the Home Loan Provider\">Step 2: Choose the Home Loan Provider<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Step_3_Fill_Up_the_Home_Loan_Application\" title=\"Step 3: Fill Up the Home Loan Application\">Step 3: Fill Up the Home Loan Application<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Step_4_Submit_the_Required_Documents\" title=\"Step 4: Submit the Required Documents\">Step 4: Submit the Required Documents<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Home_Loan_Interest_Rate_of_all_Banks_2024\" title=\"Home Loan Interest Rate of all Banks 2024\">Home Loan Interest Rate of all Banks 2024<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-3' ><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Banks\" title=\"Banks\">Banks<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Starting_Interest_Rate_pa\" title=\"Starting Interest Rate (p.a.)\">Starting Interest Rate (p.a.)<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Processing_Fees\" title=\"Processing Fees\">Processing Fees<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-10\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Step-by-Step_Guide_to_Home_Loan_Application_Process\" title=\"Step-by-Step Guide to Home Loan Application Process\">Step-by-Step Guide to Home Loan Application Process<\/a><ul class='ez-toc-list-level-3' ><li class='ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-11\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Step_1_Gather_financial_documents\" title=\"Step 1: Gather financial documents\">Step 1: Gather financial documents<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-3'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-12\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/home-loan-process\/#Step_2_Fill_out_the_Loan_Application_Form_Attach_the_Documents\" title=\"Step 2: Fill out the Loan Application Form &amp;

They are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proof of Identity (Aadhaar card is the most widely accepted document)<\/li>\n<li>PAN card<\/li>\n<li>Proof of Address (Aadhaar card, electricity bill, property tax receipt)<\/li>\n<li>Recent Salary Slips<\/li>\n<li>Bank Statements of the last 6 months<\/li>\n<li>Income tax returns of the last 3 years<\/li>\n<li>Form 16<\/li>\n<li>Loan Repayment Track Record<\/li>\n<li>Assets and Liabilities Statement<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_2_Fill_out_the_Loan_Application_Form_Attach_the_Documents\"><\/span><strong>Step 2: Fill out the Loan Application Form &amp; Attach the Documents<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In the application form, fill your name in along with your phone number, residential address, monthly\/yearly income, educational information, employment details, property details, the estimated cost of the property, etc.<\/p>\n<p>With the above details filled out, you will then have to attach photocopies of the documents mentioned in Step 1. In some cases, lenders may ask you to self-attest these photocopies \u2013 which essentially means you sign on the copies and mention the date. This indicates that you attest that these are true copies of the original documents.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_3_Document_Processing_and_Verification\"><\/span><strong>Step 3: Document Processing and Verification<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Banks and other lenders often receive many loan applications daily. For the banks to move forward with the paperwork, they will evaluate the documents. If a loan applicant furnishes forged documents, it is deemed a criminal offence.<\/p>\n<p>The banks look at the following details of the loan applicant:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place of employment, and employer credentials<\/li>\n<li>Residential address (previous and current)<\/li>\n<li>Contact numbers of residence and workplace<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A bank representative is assigned to verify these details, including workplace and residence of the loan applicant. If all the documents submitted are correct, and the information is found to be true, the loan applicant moves to the next step.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_4_Pay_the_Processing_Fee\"><\/span><strong>Step 4: Pay the Processing Fee<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>After filling out the form and attaching the relevant documents, the next step is to pay a processing fee to the bank or the lender you\u2019re borrowing the loan from. The purpose of the processing fee is to maintain the account of the loan applicant. Every year, you are expected to send a post-dated cheque and a copy of your Income Tax certificates to maintain the account.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, the processing fee ranges between 0.25% to 0.50% of the requested loan amount. For example, for a home loan of Rs. 50 lakh, the processing fee is estimated anywhere between Rs. 12,500 and Rs. 25,000.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_5_Discussion_with_the_Bank\"><\/span><strong>Step 5: Discussion with the Bank<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Before the loan amount is sanctioned, the bank \/ financial company may want to have a face-to-face interaction with the loan applicant. Usually, this is done to gather more details about the applicant and to assess if he \/ she will repay the loan with interest. More often than not, this is just a formality since all the information is already verified.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_6_Legal_and_Technical_Check\"><\/span><strong>Step 6: Legal and Technical Check<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Since banks are lending huge amounts, they are extremely cautious. Hence, a property expert is deployed to check the premises of the property. This expert could be a civil engineer or an architect or any other employee of the bank.<\/p>\n<p>During the visit to the site, the expert pays attention to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The construction stage<\/li>\n<li>Quality of construction<\/li>\n<li>Work progression<\/li>\n<li>Estimated time of completion<\/li>\n<li>Layout of the building and permissions<\/li>\n<li>Valid requisite certificates for construction on the land<\/li>\n<li>Environmental norms being followed<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If the construction is already complete, the expert will check:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Age of the property<\/li>\n<li>Internal \/ external maintenance of the property<\/li>\n<li>Loan tenure, if the building falls under the purview of eligibility<\/li>\n<li>Quality of construction<\/li>\n<li>Existing mortgages<\/li>\n<li>Building approval plan and other approvals by the government<\/li>\n<li>Property valuation<\/li>\n<li>Valid requisite certificates to handover<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Do note that a fee will be charged for this technical check, which may be recovered separately or included in the processing fee.<\/p>\n<h3><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Step_7_The_Sanction_Approval_Process\"><\/span><strong>Step 7: The Sanction \/ Approval Process<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the most crucial steps in the entire process. The decision to approve or reject the loan application lies with the bank. At any point, if the bank is unsure of the details provided by the loan applicant, they can halt the process or reject the application. However, if all goes well, the loan will be sanctioned. The approval is given based on the genuineness of the documents furnished by the loan applicant.<\/p>\n<p>The bank completes and communicates the maximum loan amount that can be sanctioned to the applicant.
