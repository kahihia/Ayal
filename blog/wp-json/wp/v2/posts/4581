Since it is directly dependent on the market, it is usually 1 or 2% lower than fixed rates offered by the same lender.<\/p>\n<p>This is why some borrowers find it appealing since lower interest means saving more money every month.

The EMI that is paid comprises two parts \u2013 one is the interest charged on the borrowed amount and the other is the principal.<\/p>\n<p>In the initial stages of your loan tenure, you pay more towards interest and not as much as towards the principal. If you get a raise or a bonus or a salary hike, you can use it to make a prepayment.

Most lenders will try to keep their good customers and may oblige. You can ask the bank to match a competitor\u2019s interest rate, or you could ask them to lower the interest rate based on your credit history.<\/p>\n<p>Then you have the option of transferring the loan to a new lender. All you have to do is find another lender that offers interest rates that suit your requirements and also check for other charges that they would levy. You can then submit an application to your current lender and obtain necessary documents then head to your new lender to process KYC and other procedures. The new lender will then implement their procedures before approving it for you.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4592 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Refinancing-your-home-loan.png\" alt=\"Refinancing-your-home-loan-to-reduce-home-loan-interest-rate\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Refinancing-your-home-loan.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Refinancing-your-home-loan-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Refinancing-your-home-loan-1024x512.png 1024w, https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/Refinancing-your-home-loan-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Must Read: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/joint-co-ownership-of-house-property-leads-to-super-savings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joint Co-Ownership Of House Property Leads To Super Savings<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"9_Take_Long_Tenure_Home_Loan_And_Start_A_SIP\"><\/span><strong>9.
