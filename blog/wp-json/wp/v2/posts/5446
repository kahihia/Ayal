While RERA guidelines may vary by state, the concept is not specifically mentioned in the central RERA Act or its guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>However, it is important to note that some state-specific RERA regulations may address the issue of UDS, or similar concepts related to the ownership of shared areas in real estate projects.

In such cases, instead of selling individual units or apartments, the developer or owner sells a specific percentage or fraction of the overall property, often referred to as the UDS. Here are some key points to consider when selling the same:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Ownership Rights: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Selling Undivided Share of Land means transferring a percentage of the overall property&#8217;s ownership rights to the buyer. The buyer becomes a co-owner of the property along with other UDS holders.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Common Areas &amp; Amenities: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Holders usually have shared ownership of shared areas, facilities, and amenities within the property, such as parking areas, gardens, clubhouses, or swimming pools.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Legal Documentation: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Like any real estate transaction, selling UDS requires proper legal documentation. This includes a sale agreement, transfer of ownership, and registration of the share in the buyer&#8217;s name.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Responsibilities &amp; Liabilities: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>UDS holders typically share responsibilities for maintaining and managing the common areas &amp; facilities.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h3><strong>Resale &amp; Transfer: <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The shares can be resold or transferred to other buyers.
