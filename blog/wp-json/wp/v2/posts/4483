Apartments are nothing but a residential space inside a building. They are designed to house a large community and offer modern-day amenities. They also come with a well-rounded security system that monitors the property 24&#215;7. An owner\/management is often the one to take charge of the building\u2019s maintenance and upkeep.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_is_an_Independent_House\"><\/span><strong>What is an Independent House?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>An independent house is constructed over a piece of land. The owner of the land has the authority to construct a house based on his\/her choice and preference. This could be self-occupied or be leased\/rented out. It could also be partially occupied and partially rented out. The owner oversees the maintenance and upkeep of the property.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Apartment_Vs_Independent_House\"><\/span><strong>Apartment Vs Independent House<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Bengaluru is now seeing a surge in demand for apartments, but that doesn\u2019t imply there are no takers for independent homes. Land prices are soaring at a faster rate than an apartment built in the same period. Hence, they also offer a better return on investment.<\/p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/bengaluru\/sobha-woodpecker-plots\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">plots<\/a> and independent homes do not offer the benefits that apartments do. Here we list out the differences in the lifestyle that each of the property offers:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>1. Maintenance:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Apartments come with minimum hassles of maintenance. Most apartments are equipped with an in-house maintenance team to fix leaky faucets or faulty doors. With designated staff taking care of filling up the overhead tanks, mowing the garden lawns, and for a host of other chores, it is a carefree way of life.<\/p>\n<p>However, in an independent home, the owner must go through the hassles of finding plumbers or carpenters, and even take it upon him\/herself to manicure the lawns.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. Amenities:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Apartments come with an array of amenities such as a swimming pool, gym, clubhouse, and a designated play area for children. These aspects make living in an apartment very convenient as opposed to an independent home.<\/p>\n<p>Although some of these amenities can be built into an individual house, the financial implications are quite huge.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Safety:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>All entrances and exits are monitored 24&#215;7 through CCTV and security guards. Hence, apartments are ideal for couples whose children return from school earlier than their parents do from work, for senior citizens or for anyone who is living alone. In fact, the close proximity of neighbours in an apartment is a comforting benefit.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from that, apartments are installed with fire extinguishers as well, providing safety. Independent homes do not offer these safety measures.<\/p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/bengaluru\/sobha-lifestyle-legacy\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">independent house<\/a>, owners may install CCTV cameras or burglar alarms for monitoring the property, which is an additional expense.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. Finance:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Banks sanction loans to verified apartments. Often, builders tie-up with banks to ease the process.<\/p>\n<p>However, for independent properties, banks conduct a thorough check before lending money, which is a time-consuming process. Often, the buyer loses out on the property due to delays caused by lengthy approval processes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. Investment:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>A first-time <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/homebuyers-must-choose-a-credible-developer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">home buyer<\/a> can confidently invest in an apartment after conducting basic research on the builder and their projects. With everything available at the click of a button, a first-time buyer can even read reviews of existing properties to get an understanding of the quality of the apartment.<\/p>\n<p>However, independent houses come with the risk of title disputes, and sometimes these can only be resolved by a court of law.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>6. Social Life:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although independent housing neighbourhoods also bring in a sense of close community, the chances of developing better social skills are much higher in apartment complexes. Community gatherings, celebrations of festivals, and parties at the clubhouse or garden area in an apartment bring people together and inspire living in harmony.<\/p>\n<p>One might argue that in an apartment, the design and d\u00e9cor of the house are decided by the builder, and the owner doesn\u2019t have much role to play. Yet, the numerous other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/top-5-advantages-of-buying-a-house-than-leasing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">advantages of owning an apartment<\/a> outweigh this area of concern.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Must Read:<\/strong> <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/8-points-to-remember-before-buying-an-apartment-in-bangalore\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">8 Points To Remember Before Buying An Apartment in Bangalore<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Apartment_or_Independent_House\"><\/span><strong>Apartment or Independent House?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Today\u2019s generation of homeowners is more focused on optimising time and living a hassle-free life. Hence, several people prefer apartments with spectacular views of the tech city while being able to access numerous amenities. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/bengaluru\/sobha-dream-gardens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apartments<\/a> are best suited for people looking for more free time, away from the worries of maintenance. This type of property is also ideal for senior citizens who can spend their retirement in tranquillity. Two of the most crucial reasons behind choosing an apartment are amenities and the security it provides.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking at it from an investment perspective, apartments are far more beneficial than an independent home. As a homeowner, you can rent\/lease out your property to tenants. Working professionals and growing families would choose this type of property because of the hassle-free lifestyle it offers.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Do_Some_Prefer_Independent_Houses\"><\/span><strong>Why Do Some Prefer Independent Houses ?<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Independent houses are preferred by those who want to buy their own plot of land and build a home according to their liking. These houses can be customised and reconstructed as per the owner\u2019s preference, with the necessary permissions. The plot of land can be optimally used to create a front yard\/backyard or even be used as a parking area.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Must Read:<\/strong> <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/blog\/tax-deductions-on-housing-loans\/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Save up to Rs7* Lakh on Tax Deductions on Housing Loans<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Investment Opportunities in the Tech City<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Bengaluru\u2019s realty scape has shown tremendous growth in the last decade, especially in the north and east regions. With a great network of roads, metro connectivity, upcoming malls, and premium educational institutes sprinkled around, the real estate sector is thriving in these two zones.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>North Bengaluru<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This region has garnered much attention after the inauguration of the Kempegowda International Airport in 2008. From affordable to luxury apartments, North Bengaluru caters to everyone\u2019s needs. With elevated expressways, wide roads, and fewer signals, travelling from one place to another is a breeze in this locality.<\/p>\n<p>An added bonus is that top IT Firms such as Manyata Tech Park, prominent schools, and reputed hospitals like Aster CMI Hospital, Columbia Asia, etc., are just a stone\u2019s throw away. Malls, cafes, and restaurants are aplenty and perfect for when you want to unwind. The upcoming metro phase 2 will only be a boon to this locality that already comes with a host of other advantages. Hence, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/bengaluru\/sobha-dream-gardens\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">buying an apartment<\/a> in North Bengaluru will prove beneficial.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>East Bengaluru<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Bengaluru East is ideal because of its ease of access to numerous tech parks, multinational companies, and railways stations. For those who wish to have beautiful scenic views and a regal residential property that is well-connected to the rest of the city, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sobha.com\/bengaluru\/sobha-dream-acres\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" rel=\"nofollow\">buying an apartment<\/a> in East Bengaluru is ideal. With the metro line running through this part of the city, it is a boon for all those who want to cut short their travel time by a significant amount.<\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While there aren\u2019t major setbacks in owning any kind of property, apartments do win the top spot in making life comfortable and stress-free.
